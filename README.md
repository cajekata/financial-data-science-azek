A set of introductory lab notebooks that we prepared for the AZEK seminar on **"Financial Data Science"**. The content of the notebooks is based on Python, IPython Notebook, and PyTorch.

Cloning the repository to Azure Notebooks: [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/financial-data-science/azek_seminar)

This is currently work in progress so expect minor errors and some rough edges ;)
